## Requirements
  * Clone the repository, and run `npm install` or  `yarn add` to set up your local environemnt. 
  * Run `npm start` to start generating wish lists.

  <br/>

  * No blank string wishes nor duplicate wishes!
  * Click on an item in the list to remove it from the list.
  * Click the submit button, but don't be scared of the alert and be prepared to have your wish list cleared!
  * No empty wish lists.

  <br/>

  * Santa's not nitpicky about the look of it, but it does match the demo! The wish list is 400px x 540px. Santa also doesn't write - what are fonts?

  <br/>
  
  * Aside from styling and reducer.jsx, all code is inside of App.jsx.
  * In particular, styling is in style.js, and is built using Styled-Components
  * React hooks and functional components were used in Santa's workshop.
